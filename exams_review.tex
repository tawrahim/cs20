The number of total outcomes is what you multiply by. An example is, from throwing a fair
coin into the air, what is the probability that we get $\frac{3}{8}$ Heads? Well the 
numerator is 8-possible ways to throw, and each throw has 2 possible outcomes so we get
$8^2$ \\

\medskip
\textbf{Example: } What is the probability that you will get $\frac{5}{16}$ Heads if you
flip a fair coin?\\
First find the denominator $2^{16}$ and then find the numerator \\

\medskip
\textbf{Example: } What are the possibilities of getting exactly 3 heads from throwing a fair
coin five times? \\
We know that the denominator will be $2^5$. Exactly 3 heads is $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3$ ways tha
we can flip our coin, but this will mean that we over counted some numbers so we have to divide
it by $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ ways. And then we end up with $\frac{10}{32}$

\textbf{Example } Whenever you see how many ways. Its very easy simply count!
